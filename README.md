Hebbian learning rule is one of the earliest and the simplest learning rules for the neural networks. "Neurons that fire together, wire together."

This code consists of 3 learning rules, basic Hebbian rule, and two variants which try to solve the problem of non stability in hebbian rule which are Oja Rule and Subtractive normalization rule.
